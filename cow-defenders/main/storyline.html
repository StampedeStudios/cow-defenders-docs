<div class="paragraph">
<p>Earth in <strong>2053</strong>, humans have been living without electricity for 12 years following a worldwide Black Out called &#8220;The Big Black Out&#8221;. The cause of this catastrophe is attributed to unexpected solar activity. Humans have adapted, living through agriculture in close contact with nature in a period resembling a slightly more advanced 1900&#8217;s. They are no longer masters of the world; at the onset of the <strong>Big Black Out</strong>, there was complete anarchy, but after 12 years, a government based on a religion condemning the past and electricity had consolidated. The sun is revered by this new religion for having rid humanity of electricity, returning it to nature. Anything from the past not used for survival is condemned. People have distanced themselves from cities, considered places where humans should never set foot again to atone for their sins. The established government is ruthless, ready to execute anyone who disrespects the rules and the religion. The protagonist is <strong>Sam</strong>, a gruff mountain man in his fifties, who has distanced himself from both cities and people. He dislikes the new world and yearns for the world of the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sam was a Machine Learning Engineer with a family when the <strong>Big Black Out</strong> occurred. They managed to survive for the first few years, but his son and wife fell ill, and without technology, he couldn&#8217;t save them. After the death of his family, he distanced himself from everything, condemning the present world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He lives on a farm far from everyone and everything, sustains himself through agriculture, and has only one hobbyâ€”attempting to make electricity work. One day, he manages to make his computer work and is contacted by an alien artificial intelligence that helps him restore electricity, revealing that the malfunction is not due to natural causes but a virus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The AI explains to Sam that this is part of military tactics by another alien species ready to take over Earth by eliminating the technologies of their adversaries. It teaches Sam how to cure the world of this virus to prompt humanity to react to the invasion. However, Sam&#8217;s plans are different; upon discovering the possibility of an invasion, he activates to defend everything dear to himâ€”the memories of the past world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sam doesn&#8217;t care about saving the world, only the memory of the past. Despite the AI&#8217;s urging, after several attempts to convince Sam to rejoin humanity, he reprograms the AI to help him only in his objective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In just one week, he develops never-before-seen technologies to protect himself from the aliens and begins the wait for the invasion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>TO BE CONTINUED</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gameplay Idea: All the levels are about the same zone, Sam&#8217;s house/farm. The levels change because there are years passing by, so we can put new paths make the enemies attack from different direction from each level (south-east, north etcâ€¦). Alien biomass approaches Sam&#8217;s house at each level making it more difficult to defend hence the new upgrades. We could create the farm of Sam so that you have to defend every piece of it to survive. For example, we have the laboratory as a physical structure where you can upgrade things between levels, and the catch is that it can be destroyed, so you can&#8217;t upgrade things anymore in the future. The silos that launches missile can have this logic too, so that you have to defend it to have this ability available.</p>
